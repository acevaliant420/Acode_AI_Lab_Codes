# Lab Report (Week 1 - Week 5)
This repository was developed as part of the CS367 curriculum at IIIT Vadodara - International Campus Diu, documenting progress and work throughout the initial five weeks.

## Week 1:

### Problem 1: Missionary and Cannibal problem
- The missionaries and cannibals problem is usually stated as follows. Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. This problem is famous in AI because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem-formulation from an analytical viewpoint.

### Problem 2: The Rabbit Leap
- In the rabbit leap problem, three east-bound rabbits stand in a line blocked by three west-bound rabbits. They are crossing a stream with stones placed in the east west direction in a line. There is one empty stone between them. The rabbits can only move forward one or two steps. They can jump over one rabbit if the need arises, but not more than that. Are they smart enough to cross each other without having to step into the water? 


## Week 2:

### Problem 1: 
- Given two text documents, the task is to align their sentences and detect plagiarism using A* search. The alignment should minimize the edit distance (or maximize similarity) between corresponding sentences.

### Problem 2: 
- Given the Puzzle-8, Design a Graph Search Agent that solves the Puzzle-8 indicating the memory and time consumption.

## Week 3:

### Problem 1: 
- Read about the game of marble solitaire. Figure shows the initial board configuration. The goal is to reach the board configuration where only one marble is left at the centre. To solve marble solitaire, (1) Implement priority queue based search considering path cost, (2) suggest two different heuristic functions with justification, (3) Implement best first search algorithm, (4) Implement A*, (5) Compare the results of various search algorithms.

### Problem 2: 
- Write a program to randomly generate k-SAT problems.  The program must accept values for k, m the number of clauses in the formula, and n the number of variables.  Each clause of length k must contain distinct variables or their negation.  Instances generated by this algorithm belong to fixed clause length models of SAT and are known as uniform random k-SAT problems.
- Write programs to solve a set of uniform random 3-SAT problems for different combinations of m and n, and compare their performance.  Try the Hill-Climbing, Beam-Search with beam widths 3 and 4, Variable-Neighborhood-Descent with 3 neighborhood functions.  Use two different heuristic functions and compare them with respect to penetrance.

## Week 4:

### Problem 1: 
- The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a hard problem, and is simple to state.  Given a  graph in which the nodes are locations of cities, and edges are labeled with the cost of traveling between cities,  find a cycle containing each city exactly once, such that the total cost of the tour is as low as possible.
- For the state of Rajasthan, find out at least twenty important tourist locations.  Suppose your relatives are about to visit you next week.  Use Simulated Annealing to plan a cost effective tour of Rajasthan.  It is reasonable to assume that the cost of traveling between two locations is proportional to the distance between them.
 
 ### Problem 2:
 - Formulate the problem as a state space search problem and solve the jigsaw puzzle using simulated annealing.

## Week 5:

### Problem 1:
- A table containing grades earned by students in respective courses is made available to you in (codes folder) 2020_bn_nb_data.txt. 
Consider grades earned in each of the courses as random variables and learn the dependencies between courses. 
- Using the data, learn the CPTs for each course node.
- What grade will a student get in PH100 if he earns DD in EC100, CC in IT101 and CD in MA101.
- The last column in the data file indicates whether a student qualifies for an internship program or not. From the given data, take 70 percent data for training and build a naive Bayes classifier (considering that the grades earned in different courses are independent of each other) which takes in the studentâ€™s performance and returns the qualification status with a probability.
- Test your classifier on the remaining 30 percent data. Repeat this experiment for 20 random selection of training and testing data. Report results about the accuracy of your classifier.
Repeat 4, considering that the grades earned in different courses may be dependent.

 ## Bonus Problem:
-  Challenge for you is to generate a melody in North Indian Classical Raag Bhairav using either simulated annealing or the genetic algorithm.
